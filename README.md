VisualDict

Related words means that they are connected somehow. Related concepts/words form a graph (sometimes called wordnet).
VisualDict is supposed to replace google phrasebook, which is hardly editable and does not permit to group related words in other way than linear list of pairs.

It is in the groundwork stage. I have implemented the DB (used Google Realtime API) and tried two graphical front-ends but they suck.

You can add/remove nodes. We need to visualize this.
