VisualDict

Related words means that they are connected in one way on another.
Related concepts/words form a graph (sometimes called wordnet).
This VisualDict is supposed to replace google phrasebook, which is 
hardly editable, low performance in the browswer and does not 
permit to group related words in other way than linear list of 
pairs.

The project is in usable stage. I have implemented the DB (used 
Google Realtime API) and tried various graphical front-ends. Check 
out the demo at http://valtih1978.github.io/VisualDict/almende-vis.html.
It sill needs color indication of language and dynamic show/hide.
