Visual Dictionary

Related words means that they are connected in one way on another.
Related concepts/words form a graph (sometimes called wordnet).
This VisualDict is supposed to replace google phrasebook, which is 
hardly editable, low performance, is limited to 5000 words or so and 
does not permit grouping related words in way other than linear list of 
pairs.

I have implemented it usig Google Realtime API for DB (theoretically, 
you can share a dictionary and build it collaboratively ) and almende 
front-end. Check out the demo at http://valtih1978.github.io/VisualDict/almende-vis.html.
