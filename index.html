	This is a project to replace <a href="https://translate.google.com">
	google.translate phrasebook</a>	with decent editor, which 
	allows to place related words closely next to each other.
	Here you can edit the graph using the buttons yet <a href="javascript:redirect('almende-vis.html')"> 
	visual editor was started</a> (based on Almende example 21, see 
	below). I think that it has reached usable stage. Yet, we need 
	to add dynamic autoexpand/collapse functionality on mouse 
	hover, the way <a href="http://arborjs.org"> arborjs.org</a> 
	and <a href="http://maxdemarzi.com/2013/05/29/visualizing-the-news-with-vivagraph-js/">
	VivaGraph (example down)</a> propose, as well as language
	differentiation (node color?). Currently, related words are
	enumerated through comma in the DB (comma  is forbidden in 
	the words, therefore, though this may be wrong idea if we 
	are building a phrasebook rather than ordinary dictionary). 
	Nevertheless, so far, I think that words could
	be stored prefixed with language, like en: and et: making
	semicolon forbidden as well. Anyway, I have started the 
	<a href="javascript:redirect('options.html')">options</a> page.
	
	Might 
	be some integration with google translate is also required.
	Supporting import of google-exported prasebook is required
	for sure.
	
		<p>
	Unlike most graph models, current graph model avoids 
	node/edge ids. Nodes are identified with words/labels. This 
	complicates renaming and might inflate DB size. Yet, 
	<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28196581/locking-in-google-realtime-db">
	not all identifiers are shorter than natural words.</a>
		<p>
		Thanks to Google Drive Realtime API (<a href="http://valjok.blogspot.com/2015/01/cloud-storage.html">
		how I have picked it</a>), you can 
	<a target="_blank" href="#">produce word nets collaboratively.</a> 
	Though, this might be an overkill and is not reliable at all 
	(can be corrupted due to concurrency, see link above) but 
	unavoidable with Google RT and enableds undo/redo for free. 
	The database is stored in VisualDict file your google drive.
	You may rename it or copy it for backup and switch files 
	(trashed files are not visible for picking).
	<hr>
	Here is mine analysis of graph-drawing engines.<p>
		<li>
	<a href="javascript:redirect('cytoscape.html')">Cytoscape</a> 
	loads realtime data but fails to make connections. Cytoscape 
	seems good visualizer (now, I think it is not) and can layout
	new nodes but it is unsatisfactory editor.</li><li>
	<a href="javascript:redirect('graph-creator.html')">Graph Creator</a> 
	Thoug it does support "make connections" facility, it does not support automatic layout and
	Integration with Realtime Model was not even started.</li>
	<li>
		I have later realized that I can connect nodes like this 
		https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4189520/GraphJS/graphjs.html 
		-- simply by selecting two nodes. It also worth to try web-cola
		and <a href="javascript:redirect('vivagraph.html')">VivaGraphJS</a> in place of cytoscape. They seem to provide better 
		and be more "dynamic" layout with less verbose API.
		<p> VivaGraph looks very nice and allows a lot of freedom 
			in drawing the objects. You can specify connections (links)
			without nodes (nodes are added automatically).
			However, events, eg. "hover" areachieved
			by manual drawing of the objects, which I do not like. 
			This issue is further aggraviated by stupid API, where we have 
			to write Viva.Graph.svg('circle').attr('r', 10).attr("fill", "red")
			instead of Viva.Graph.svg('circle', {r:1, color:"red"}).
			<p>VivoGraph maintains <a href="http://anvaka.github.io/graph-drawing-libraries/#/all">
			a list of graphical libraries</a>. <a href="http://anvaka.github.io/graph-drawing-libraries/#/library/dhotson_springy">
			Springy</a> example seems the thing that we are lookig for. It howerver 
			drwas arrows (which might be confusing) and seems too dynamic 
			(use too much CPU resources). But more static Cytoscape is hardly a solution
			because its layout is too dumb.
	</li>

	<a href="javascript:redirect('almende-vis.html')">
		almende_vis</a> and <a href="alchemy.html">Graph Alchemist</a> 
	may solve this problem. It allows to select multiple nodes is the 
	example and stabilizes (stops consuming CPU cycles) after a while. 
	Almende network has strange multiselect behaviour: you must keep longer
	rather than shift-click. Adding nodes is <a href="view-source:http://almende.github.io/chap-links-library/js/network/examples/example12_adding_nodes.html">more than terrible</a> though. It requireds creating intermediate tables. The funny thing is that mine network does not have any addNode(s)/addLink(s) methods! GrphAlchemist on the other hand might be a great library but it is impossible to start with. Docks <a hre="https://github.com/GraphAlchemist/Alchemy/issues/343#issuecomment-71804741">suck from very beginning</a> and describe some inexisting configuraion properties. At least I could not find what <a href="http://graphalchemist.github.io/Alchemy/#/docs">nodeCaption</a> applies to. When I try to pan my example, it fails with Cannot read property 'conf' of undefined and "Cannot read property 'vis' of undefined" in alchemy.min.js. Yet, they somehow do that in examples: <a href="http://almende.github.io/vis/examples/network/16_dynamic_data.html">16 manual graph editor</a> and <a href="http://almende.github.io/vis/examples/network/21_data_manipulation.html">21 visual graph editor</a> (<a href="https://github.com/almende/vis/tree/master/examples/network">sources</a>)

	<p>
	We will load data incrementally. If user wants to clean up the screen - let him refresh.
	We will also maintain uneditable but seekable list, like phrasebook does for search.
